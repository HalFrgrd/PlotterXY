Only print one Y-axis folder - depending on what extrusion profile you are using for your y-axis.

# Hardware build guide

1. Print out a corner pulley mount and check that it fits snuggly into your v-slot extrusion. If it doesn't you might need to recalibrate your printer.
2. Print out all the parts. The number at the end of the filename is the quantity you'll need — so Pulley_2.3mf means you need 2.
3. Build up the z-axis gantry and slide it on to the y-axis.
5. Build up the y-axis gantries and attach them to the y-axis extrusion. Keep the screws that hold it to the y-axis loose for now.
6. Install the end caps and servo mounts to the extusions so you have an open sided C shape. Note the orientation of the serve mounts, they are opposite ways up with the flat part in the middle of the extrusion.
7. Slide the y-axis on to the extrusion.
8. Install the pulley mounts, end caps and attach the final extrusion to close the frame.
9. Adjust all the mount screws until the frame is square. The y-axis should slide left to right freely. Tighten the screws that hold the y-axis in place.
10. Install all the pulleys. They pulleys should sit on a single shim spacer, with two shims in between the two bearings.
11. Install the servos in to the servo mounts, being sure to vertically align the toothed pulley with the pulleys on the mount.
12. Install belts and attach to gantry. They should not be tight at this stage — but should not droop.
13. Install belt tensioners and tension the belts to the same frequency.
14. Build up pen lift and install on to gantry. Attach the solenoid to the heater output on the controller board.
15. Install limit switches and wire to TB and TE connector on board.
