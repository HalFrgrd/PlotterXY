A series of macros useful for operating the plotter.
The park macro will need to be updated to reflect the size of your machine.

home = move to 0,0
park = move the gantry out of the way to the top right

The ***_UR macros are for helping to align materials. Use the home macro, place the bottom left corner of your material where the pen is. Then use the ***_UR macro to align the top right corner.
