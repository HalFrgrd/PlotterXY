A series of macros useful for operating the plotter.
The park macro will need to be updated to reflect the size of your machine.

home = move to 0,0

park = move the gantry out of the way to the top right

The A*_UR macros are for helping to align materials. Run the home macro, then place the bottom left corner of your material where the pen is â€“ then run the A*_UR macro and align the top right corner.
