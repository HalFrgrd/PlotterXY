PlotterXY uses FluidNC: https://github.com/bdring/FluidNC

1. Install FluidNC on your FYSETC E4.
2. Upload the yaml config file to your board.
3. Restart the machine.

Be sure to use the supplied heatsinks, they should go on the rear of the board. I recommend using up the two spare heatsinks on the front of the ICs too.

*Note that the Y stepper is connected to the connector labelled Z-MOT â€“ this is just to help thermals.

Connections:
* X-MOT: X stepper motor
* Z-MOT: Y stepper motor
* X-MIN: X limit switch
* Y-MIN: Y limit switch (on the z-axis gantry)
* HEATER: Solenoid

Check that these two jumpers are set for UART:

Before switching on the first time, move the gantry in to the centre of the work area. Turn on and connect to the web UI. Click on the clear alarm button. Use the jog function to check that the gantry moves in the correct direction. If it does not, then adjust the direction_pin in the config file from high to low on the relevant axis.

You will need to adjust the max_travel_mm and mpos_mm values in the config file for both the x and y axes to reflect the size of your plotter. The mpos_mm value should match the max_travel_mm. It is best to home the machine with the default settings, and then use a tape measure to get the dimensions. When homing move the z-gantry somewhere close to the top right by hand before you turn the plotter on, a couple of centimetres away from the limit swiches. Start off configuring it with a smaller size and then check out the movement of the machine with the jog function to make sure that the z-axis doesn't crash in to the right and bottom extrusions when you move it to 0,0.

Depending on your pen lift mechanism and pen weight you may need to adjust the solenoid pull_percent and hold_percent if the solenoid does not manage to lift or hold the pen.



## My version
When you upload the config, it might use the default values without telling you.
There is a mistake in the config.
